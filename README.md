## Introduction


We’d like to thank everyone who took part in our bounty program, all of you guys who helped us spread the word about MoneyToken.

In MoneyToken, we believe in transparency and open communication with our hunter community and project proponents. Thus, we provide a detailed report on the distribution of tokens and analysis of the results.

* The total amount of the bounty pool is 97,328,526 IMT, this is equivalent to a 0.5% supply, or 486,642 $
* You can find the detailed distribution spreadsheet [`here`](https://github.com/icobase/moneytoken/blob/master/Whitelist).
* Contract address: [`0x13119e34e140097a507b07a5564bde1bc375d9e6`](https://etherscan.io/token/0x13119e34e140097a507b07a5564bde1bc375d9e6)
* Payment is made in the tokens of [moneytoken.com](https://moneytoken.com/)
* Each member's amount of bounty IMT tokens will be calculated using the following formula below:

`(Total amount of bounty campaign IMT tokens/Total amount of bounty campaign participants' stakes)*Member's stakes`

Interpreters will receive additional compensation - from the pool of the team.
A lot of work has been done that was not previously included in the task list.

### Red Trust

There is clear evidence that the account farming is on a professional scale, this creates an endless cycle of meaningless spam. These professional users are very good at their job. You will not see the obvious, if you do not look. They are the main cause of spam.

Some DT members will remain incognito until the implementation of the Red Trust.

� All accounts, scammers and other participants who abuse the trust of `MoneyToken` will be marked `"red trust"` so that they can not join other campaigns.

## Audit Summary

### Overview

There are many bounty campaign, whose activities can not be analyzed in a reasonable time. This situation has become a kind of stimulus for the development and use of the `account farming`. The problem is that most companies are too busy trying to focus on their products and business problems in order to spend time on the community.

`Artificial audience` is one of the reasons why projects can not generate a sustainable income. One possible solution to this problem is the use of unique filters for each section according to rules.

***

### Methodology

We have considered in detail all the available documentation and reports on the bounty made by the manager. Secondly, we conducted a `thorough manual review` of several thousand accounts, checking their compliance. Finally, we performed the `automatic part` of the review.

When checking each report and checking each type of campaign, the bounty manager uses at least 8 filters. The audit was conducted using both `proprietary and publicly available tools`.

***

### Structure

![Bounty Filters](https://i.imgur.com/3gMKh51.png)

`Analysis of individual sections` of the report shows a high non-compliance ratio. Then we used `logical methods` to separate the structure of the report into parts. To determine the relationship between the accounts, we took into account the `probability of crossing several events` that do not depend on each other.

### Summary of Findings

We prefer to build an `organic community`, so we clearly share the line between aggressive marketing and ideological advancement. Such an audience is more optimistic when making decisions.

Technically speaking, `"audit"` has determined the effectiveness of marketing activities and is reduced to identifying problems in the strategy of community formation.

>     Real results have allowed us to focus on those who contribute to building confidence in our products and services.
>     Community support is important, so we minimize the risk that users take when investing in MoneyToken.



## KYC procedure 

### Why is a complete KYC implemented?

Due to the progress in the development of the platform and the requirements of our new partnerships, we decided to conduct a full AML/KYC procedure. This is important for scaling and complying with the rules of jurisdictions in which we obtained financial licenses, as well as to confirm that the income of MoneyToken is not a consequence of criminal activity or sanctioned funds.

In addition, this is a better way to prevent spam, and account farming. Bots can join airdrop and bounty, but they can not pass the KYC check. Therefore, we decided to include airdrop/bounty participants in the KYC/AML process as a means of protecting ourselves (and all legitimate participants).
